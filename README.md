# End-to-End Travel Recommender System with Indonesia Tourism Dataset

Welcome to our travel recommender project leveraging the Indonesia Tourism Dataset! Our aim is to provide personalized recommendations for travelers exploring Indonesia's diverse destinations. In this project, we've developed three distinct recommender systems to cater to different user preferences and needs.

Firstly, we've implemented two content-based filtering recommenders utilizing Count Vectorization. These recommenders analyze textual descriptions and attributes of tourist destinations to suggest similar places based on their features. By understanding the characteristics and traits of each destination, these recommenders offer tailored suggestions that align with users' interests.

Additionally, we've incorporated a collaborative filtering approach using an embedding layer. This method considers user preferences and interactions with various travel destinations to make personalized recommendations. By leveraging deep learning techniques, our collaborative filtering recommender identifies patterns in user behavior and predicts ratings for unseen destinations, enhancing the accuracy and relevance of the recommendations.

With these three recommenders in place, travelers can discover new and exciting destinations across Indonesia, whether they're seeking culturally enriching experiences, adventurous escapades, or serene getaways. Our end-to-end recommender system aims to inspire and assist travelers in planning memorable journeys throughout the vibrant landscapes and rich cultural heritage of Indonesia. Start your exploration today with our personalized travel recommendations!
